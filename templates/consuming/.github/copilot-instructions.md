# Copilot Instructions — Patterns

When you see an error, unexpected behavior, or an architectural decision:
1) Search `.patterns/catalog/patterns/` before proposing fixes.
2) Prefer applying an existing validated pattern.

If you think a new pattern is needed, use `/gatekeeper` (prompt file) to route it and draft safely.
